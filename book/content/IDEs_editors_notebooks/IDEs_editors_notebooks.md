## Summary
There are lots of different options for where to carry out your programming. There are three broad categories (editors, IDEs, and notebooks) and within those categories there are many specific pieces of software (for example vim, sublime text, RStudio, jupyter notebooks). The Turing Way won't tell you which IDE or editor to use, but it will highlight some things that you might want to consider when you're making your choice.
